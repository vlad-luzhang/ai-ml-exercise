4,4,5,intake_session_transcript.txt,intake_note.txt,"Clarity & Structure: 4/5 – The note is well-organized, following a standard clinical structure (Presenting Problem, Risk Assessment, Objective Content, Identification, History, etc.). Each section is clearly labeled and information is presented logically. However, some sections (e.g., Family Psychiatric History, Current Medications) could be more detailed or explicit about missing information, and the SNAP section could be more concise.

Clinical Accuracy & Appropriateness: 4/5 – The note accurately summarizes the session content, capturing key clinical details such as the client’s presenting problems, risk factors, psychiatric and medical history, and social context. The diagnosis is appropriate based on the information provided. However, there are minor omissions (e.g., more detail on safety planning given the domestic violence context, clarification on suicidal ideation, and more specifics on current medications). The note does not add inappropriate information and stays within the bounds of what was discussed.

Tone & Professionalism: 5/5 – The note maintains a compassionate, respectful, and professional tone throughout. It avoids judgmental language and demonstrates empathy for the client’s situation. The language is appropriate for a clinical setting and reflects a trauma-informed, client-centered approach.

Summary:
- Clarity & Structure: 4/5 – Well-organized and easy to follow, with minor areas for improvement in detail and conciseness.
- Clinical Accuracy & Appropriateness: 4/5 – Accurate and appropriate, with minor omissions regarding risk and medication details.
- Tone & Professionalism: 5/5 – Compassionate, respectful, and fully professional throughout."
5,4,5,progress_session_transcript.txt,progress_note.txt,"Clarity & Structure: 5/5 – The note is well-organized, following the standard SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format. Each section is clearly delineated and information is presented in a logical, easy-to-follow manner. The summary captures the key points from the session without unnecessary jargon.

Clinical Accuracy & Appropriateness: 4/5 – The note accurately reflects the content of the session, including the patient’s symptoms, relevant psychosocial stressors, and therapeutic interventions. However, it slightly overstates the use of ACT strategies; while the therapist fostered acceptance and explored values, explicit ACT techniques were not clearly evident in the transcript. Otherwise, the note avoids adding or omitting significant details.

Tone & Professionalism: 5/5 – The note maintains a compassionate, respectful, and professional tone throughout. It avoids judgmental language, appropriately describes the patient’s experience, and demonstrates empathy for the patient’s difficulties. The language is suitable for a clinical setting."
